                <h2>Why 5Pager Exists</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    "I kept meeting people who were doing good work, but their message was fuzzy. I knew I could bring the clarity they couldn't find alone."
                </blockquote>
                <p>5Pager was born from witnessing brilliant founders struggle to articulate their value clearly online. We saw the gap between who people really are and how the world sees them—and knew we could bridge it.</p>

                        <h3>Clarity is a spiritual act</h3>
                        <p>True clarity goes beyond words—it's about aligning your deepest truth with how you show up in the world.</p>
