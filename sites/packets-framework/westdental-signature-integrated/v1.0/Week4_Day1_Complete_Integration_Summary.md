## ðŸ”§ Technical Integration Architecture

### Component Data Mapping System
```html
<section data-component="comp_001" 
         data-archetype="safe_harbor" 
         data-act="act1_arrival" 
         data-emotional-goal="immediate-calm-and-curiosity-activation">
```

### CSS Variable Signature Framework
```css
:root {
    --emotional-temperature: 0.7;
    --safety-intensity: 0.8;
    --wisdom-intensity: 0.6;
    --recognition-intensity: 0.5;
    --breathing-room-multiplier: 1.0;
    --emotional-intensity: 0.0;
}
```

### JavaScript Progression Coordination
```javascript
// Time-based progression
this.acts = {
    act1_arrival: { timeframe: { start: 0, end: 10 }, ... },
    act2_exploration: { timeframe: { start: 10, end: 45 }, ... },
    // ... continues for all five acts
};

// Scroll-based enhancement
this.actThresholds = {
    act1_arrival: { start: 0, end: 0.15 },
    act2_exploration: { start: 0.1, end: 0.45 },
    // ... synchronized with time-based system
};
```
