                    <p class="hero-description">Founded on the belief that everyone deserves to eat, speak, and smile without shame, West Dental represents a different approach to dental care—one that honors both the science of dentistry and the art of human connection.</p>

                <h2>The Journey to West Dental</h2>
                <div class="story-content">
                    <div class="story-text">
                        <p>Dr. Karm Jandoo founded West Dental because he couldn't find a place that held both precision and compassion as equal values. During his early NHS training and private clinic experience, he realized that most dental practices either rushed patients through procedures or focused purely on cosmetic upsells without genuine care.</p>

                        <p>The turning point came when patients started crying in his chair—not from pain, but from relief at finally being truly seen and heard. He knew then that he wasn't just doing procedures; he was restoring people's relationship with themselves.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"I used to think I needed to be 'clinical' to be professional. Now I know that warmth and connection are the strongest tools I have."</p>
                            <cite>— Dr. Karm Jandoo</cite>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>Dr. Karm believes in calm clarity. His gift lies in helping people feel safe in a space most associate with fear or shame. He listens carefully, explains thoroughly, and respects the intelligence of his patients. There are no flashy upsells or gimmicks—just truth, long-term trust, and visible transformation.</p>
