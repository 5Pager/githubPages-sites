## Dr. Karm's Story

### Section Headline
The Journey to West Dental

### Origin Story
Dr. Karm Jandoo founded West Dental because he couldn't find a place that held both precision and compassion as equal values. During his early NHS training and private clinic experience, he realized that most dental practices either rushed patients through procedures or focused purely on cosmetic upsells without genuine care.

The turning point came when patients started crying in his chair—not from pain, but from relief at finally being truly seen and heard. He knew then that he wasn't just doing procedures; he was restoring people's relationship with themselves.

"I used to think I needed to be 'clinical' to be professional," Dr. Karm reflects. "Now I know that warmth and connection are the strongest tools I have."

### Personal Philosophy
Dr. Karm believes in calm clarity. His gift lies in helping people feel safe in a space most associate with fear or shame. He listens carefully, explains thoroughly, and respects the intelligence of his patients. There are no flashy upsells or gimmicks—just truth, long-term trust, and visible transformation.

## Our Approach

This Is Where Form Meets Function

### The West Dental Difference
At West Dental, we understand that the mouth represents your primary interface with the world—how you nourish yourself, communicate your thoughts, and express joy. When someone struggles with their smile, they're essentially cut off from full participation in life.

### Our Core Beliefs
- **Everyone deserves freedom**: The freedom to eat, speak, and smile without worry or shame
- **Real dentistry addresses both form and function**: Never one without the other
- **Trust and transformation go hand in hand**: You can't have lasting results without genuine relationship
- **Self-respect begins with feeling comfortable in your own skin**: Your smile should reflect who you've become
