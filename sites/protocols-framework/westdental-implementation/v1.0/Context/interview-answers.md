Based on Interview with Dr. Karm Jandoo (Simulated for 5Pager Context)

## 1. The Real You (Identity Layer)

- **Name**: Dr. Karm Jandoo  
- **What people don’t know**: I’m a perfectionist — but not in the way people think. I care deeply about clarity. When someone sits in my chair, I want them to leave with more than just clean teeth — I want them to feel seen.  
- **First felt called**: I realised early on that dentistry was an unusual blend of science, art, and trust. That combination grabbed me and never let go.  
- **My gift**: Calm clarity. I help people feel safe in a space most people associate with fear or shame.  
- **How I’ve changed**: I used to think I needed to be “clinical” to be professional. Now I know that warmth and connection are the strongest tools I have.  
- **What I’ve let go of**: The need to impress other dentists. I care more about how my patients feel.

## 2. The Origin Story (Myth Layer)

- **How it started**: I started West Dental because I couldn’t find a place that held both precision and compassion as equal values.  
- **The shift to mission**: When patients started crying in the chair — not from pain, but from relief. That’s when I knew I wasn’t just doing procedures.  
- **Almost gave up?**: During the early days, when overheads were tight and I felt isolated. I wasn’t sure this way of doing dentistry could survive in a world of chains.  
- **What changed?**: Realising I didn’t need to compete with chains — I just needed to be more *me*. That was my edge.  
- **Movie act breaks**:  
  - Act 1: NHS training  
  - Act 2: Private clinic burnout  
  - Act 3: West Dental born out of alignment  
  - Act 4: Rediscovery of purpose through deep patient impact

## 3. The Work Itself (Transformation Layer)

- **What people are buying**: A sense of self-respect. The freedom to eat, speak, and smile without shame.  
- **What makes it different**: We don’t rush. We don’t sell. We *see*. Our check-up is a diagnostic experience, not a sales pitch.  
- **Client journey example**: One woman came in with cracked veneers, embarrassed and distrustful. We built a step-by-step plan — by the end, she told me it was the first time she felt her smile matched who she was inside.  
- **What surprises clients**: How gentle it feels — emotionally. How much we listen.  
- **Ideal client**: Someone who’s self-aware and ready to invest in themselves.  
- **Not for**: People who just want something cheap and fast.
