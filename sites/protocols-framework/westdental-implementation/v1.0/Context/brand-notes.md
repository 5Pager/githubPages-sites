## 🧑‍⚕️ Founder Profile

**Name:** Dr. Karm Jandoo  
**Location:** Glasgow West End  
**Vibe:** Calm, compassionate, clinically precise. Karm leads with empathy and integrity. He doesn't push flashy upsells or gimmicks — he listens carefully, explains thoroughly, and respects the intelligence of his patients. He values truth, long-term trust, and visible transformation.

## 🏛️ Clinic Identity

West Dental is a high-trust, premium-feel dental studio in the heart of Glasgow’s West End. While it offers cosmetic services, the underlying positioning is not vanity-driven — it's about helping people bring their external appearance into alignment with their internal growth. The smile becomes a symbol of self-respect.

---

## 💎 Core Brand Idea

**"Smile with self-respect."**  
Not all dentists are the same. West Dental is for people who care how they feel — not just how they look.

---

## 💡 Primary Offer

**£95 Smile Check-Up** (Diagnostic Entry Point)

This is the front door to the full “Smile Journey” — a warm, precise, non-pushy diagnostic process that includes:

- Full dental check
- Intraoral 3D scan
- X-rays
- Smile diagnosis
- Treatment plan & clear next steps

It's not a free consult. It’s a valuable experience with clinical substance.

> **Framing**: “Let’s make sure your smile reflects the person you’ve become.”
