          <h2>The Smile Journey: How we work differently</h2>
          <p class="method-intro-text">Over the years, I've discovered that the best dental outcomes happen when people feel completely understood before any treatment begins. That's why we've developed what we call the Smile Journey — a process that puts your story, your concerns, and your goals at the center of everything we do.</p>

          <div class="key-insight">
            <h3>The real problem isn't technical</h3>
            <p>Most dental anxiety doesn't come from the procedures themselves. It comes from feeling rushed, misunderstood, or pressured into decisions you're not ready for. That's why our approach focuses on clarity and trust first, treatment second.</p>

              <h3 class="step-title">The Story</h3>
              <p class="step-description">Before I even look in your mouth, we talk. About how you feel about your smile. What you love, what bothers you, what you dream might be possible. I want to understand your relationship with your smile — because that's what we're really working with.</p>

              <h3 class="step-title">The Investigation</h3>
              <p class="step-description">Now we examine what's actually happening. Comprehensive dental check, 3D scan, X-rays — all the technical work that shows us the complete picture. But unlike other practices, I explain everything as we go, so you understand exactly what we're seeing.</p>

              <p class="step-description">This is where most dentists stop — but for us, it's where the real work begins. I translate all the technical findings into clear, honest language. What's working well, what needs attention, and what's possible for your specific situation.</p>
