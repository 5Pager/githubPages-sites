    <!-- The Story -->
    <section class="story-section section-warm">

        <div class="story-content">

          <div class="story-block">
            <h2>The reluctant helper</h2>
            <p>During my NHS training, patients started seeking me out. Not because I was the most technically skilled — though I was thorough — but because I listened differently. Colleagues would joke that I spent too much time talking with patients. "You're not a therapist, Karm," they'd say.</p>

            <p>But something was happening in those conversations. People were telling me things they'd never told a dentist before. About how their smile affected their confidence. How they avoided photos at family gatherings. How they covered their mouth when they laughed.</p>

            <p>I kept telling them I was just doing my job. I wasn't qualified to help with those deeper concerns. I was a dentist, not a counsellor.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="story-block">
            <h2>The recognition</h2>
            <p>The turning point came with Mrs. Henderson. She'd been my patient for two years, coming in for routine cleanings. Always polite, always quiet. One day, she mentioned she was getting married again at 58 — her first wedding photos in decades.</p>

            <p>"I want to feel like myself in the pictures," she said. "Not the version of me that's been hiding."</p>

            <p>We spent the next hour talking about what that meant. When she left with a treatment plan for subtle veneers, she hugged me. "Thank you for seeing me," she said.</p>

            <p>That's when I realised what I'd been doing all along. I wasn't just fixing teeth. I was helping people reclaim parts of themselves they'd lost.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="story-block">
            <h2>The acceptance</h2>
            <p>I tried to ignore it at first. Stick to the clinical side. But patient after patient kept having the same experience. They'd come in for a cleaning and leave feeling understood. They'd book a simple procedure and discover it was about so much more than aesthetics.</p>

            <p>I started to see that my "flaw" — caring too much about how people felt — wasn't a weakness. It was exactly what people needed from their dentist.</p>

            <p>The mouth is intimate. It's where we eat, speak, kiss, smile, express joy. Working in someone's mouth requires trust. And trust, I learned, comes from being truly seen.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="story-block">
            <h2>West Dental is born</h2>
            <p>I left the NHS system to create something different. Not because I wanted to charge more, but because I wanted to spend more time. Time to listen. Time to understand. Time to help people discover what's possible when their smile matches who they've become.</p>

            <p>West Dental isn't about perfect teeth. It's about that moment when you look in the mirror and recognise yourself. When you smile without thinking about it. When your outer expression aligns with your inner growth.</p>

            <p>That's what I've been helping people with all along. I just finally stopped apologising for it.</p>

              <p>I believe the same qualities that make me a good dentist — patience, attention to detail, genuine care for others — show up in all areas of life. Whether I'm listening to a patient's concerns or having a conversation with a friend, it's about being present and truly seeing the person in front of you.</p>

              <p>Glasgow's West End has been my home for years, and I love being part of this community. There's something special about helping neighbours, friends, and families feel more confident about their smiles.</p>
