## Completed Steps
1. ✅ Analyzed source projects in `../aiFrameworksSource/`
2. ✅ Identified all static HTML outputs (5 projects found)
3. ✅ Created organized directory structure
4. ✅ Copied relevant files with version management (v1.0 + latest symlinks)
5. ✅ Created responsive index page with project navigation
6. ✅ Configured GitHub Pages settings (_config.yml)
7. ✅ Made initial git commit with comprehensive description

## Remaining Steps
1. Test all site links and functionality
2. Verify GitHub Pages deployment
3. Document final deployment process
4. Add any missing assets or configurations

## Version Management Strategy
- Each project will have versioned subdirectories
- `latest/` will always point to the most recent stable version
- Index page will show both latest and available versions
- Historical versions preserved for reference

## GitHub Pages Configuration
- Will use root directory deployment
- Custom domain support ready if needed
- All static assets properly organized
- SEO-friendly structure with proper meta tags

## Success Criteria
- All static sites accessible via GitHub Pages
- Clean, professional index page
- Proper version management
- Mobile-responsive design
- Fast loading times
- Clear documentation
