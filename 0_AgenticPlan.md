## Current Status
- [x] Repository initialized with basic structure
- [ ] Source projects analyzed
- [ ] Directory structure designed
- [ ] HTML sites copied and organized
- [ ] GitHub Pages configuration completed
- [ ] Index page created
- [ ] Testing and validation

## Next Steps
1. Analyze source projects in `../aiFrameworksSource/`
2. Identify all static HTML outputs
3. Create organized directory structure
4. Copy relevant files with version management
5. Create responsive index page with project navigation
6. Configure GitHub Pages settings
7. Test all sites and links
8. Document deployment process

## Version Management Strategy
- Each project will have versioned subdirectories
- `latest/` will always point to the most recent stable version
- Index page will show both latest and available versions
- Historical versions preserved for reference

## GitHub Pages Configuration
- Will use root directory deployment
- Custom domain support ready if needed
- All static assets properly organized
- SEO-friendly structure with proper meta tags

## Success Criteria
- All static sites accessible via GitHub Pages
- Clean, professional index page
- Proper version management
- Mobile-responsive design
- Fast loading times
- Clear documentation
