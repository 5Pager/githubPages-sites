# Agentic Plan for GitHub Pages Static Sites Repository

## Project Overview
This repository serves as a centralized hosting location for multiple static HTML sites to be deployed via GitHub Pages. The source projects are located in `../aiFrameworksSource/` and contain various AI framework documentation or demonstration sites.

## Current Status
- [x] Repository initialized with basic structure
- [x] Source projects analyzed
- [x] Directory structure designed
- [x] HTML sites copied and organized
- [x] GitHub Pages configuration completed
- [x] Index page created
- [x] Version management implemented
- [x] Initial git commit completed
- [x] Repository reorganized by framework type
- [x] Source directories renamed for clarity
- [ ] Testing and validation
- [ ] Final deployment verification

## Directory Structure Implemented

## Completed Steps
1. ✅ Analyzed source projects in `../aiFrameworksSource/`
2. ✅ Identified all static HTML outputs (5 projects found)
3. ✅ Created organized directory structure
4. ✅ Copied relevant files with version management (v1.0 + latest symlinks)
5. ✅ Created responsive index page with project navigation
6. ✅ Configured GitHub Pages settings (_config.yml)
7. ✅ Made initial git commit with comprehensive description
8. ✅ Reorganized by framework type (Packets vs Protocols)
9. ✅ Enhanced index page with framework categorization
10. ✅ Renamed source directories for clarity

## Remaining Steps
1. Test all site links and functionality
2. Verify GitHub Pages deployment
3. Document final deployment process
4. Add any missing assets or configurations

## Version Management Strategy
- Each project will have versioned subdirectories
- `latest/` will always point to the most recent stable version
- Index page will show both latest and available versions
- Historical versions preserved for reference

## GitHub Pages Configuration
- Will use root directory deployment
- Custom domain support ready if needed
- All static assets properly organized
- SEO-friendly structure with proper meta tags

## Success Criteria
- All static sites accessible via GitHub Pages
- Clean, professional index page
- Proper version management
- Mobile-responsive design
- Fast loading times
- Clear documentation

## Framework Implementations Successfully Deployed

### Packets Framework (Cortical Packet Processing)
1. **Abstract Template** - `/sites/packets-framework/abstract-template/latest/`
2. **WestDental Implementation** - `/sites/packets-framework/westdental-implementation/latest/`
3. **5Pager Meta Site** - `/sites/packets-framework/5pager-meta/latest/`
